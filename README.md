How it works

You use the app to anonymously send a picture of the area you're concerned about and our medical professionals will review and respond to your query with a short report and next action steps (if any are required).

LIFELOGGING

PROBLEM
HEALTHCARE IS HARD TO ACCESS - this is easy!
EXPENSIVE - this is free!
STDs carry a STIGMA - this is anonymous!

Saves time. No need to go to a doctor (can involve a lot of travel in the developing world). 


Saves money. Doctors are expensive. Tests/medicines are expensive.


Tabibu is a project by Tomas Ruta (@tomasruta), Sofia Zab (@sofiazab), Billy Rood, Sam Mbale (@mpelembe) and Ahmad Bakh.

Our mission is to end the sexual disease crisis in the developing world.
